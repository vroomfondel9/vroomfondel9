			<h1>Deception and Manipulation: A Playstyle Guide for Illusionists</h1>
			
			<h3>A <em>Playstyle</em> Guide?</h3>
			
			<p>This is a guide about how to most effectively deceive and manipulate your opponents with Illusions. This is not a mechanics guide. It will not tell you the best way to build an Illusionist or give you <span style="color: blue;">color</span>-<span style="color: red;">coded</span> spell, class, and race choices.</p>
			
			<p>The reason for this is because the effectiveness of an Illusionist is more dependent on <em>how you play</em> rather than <em>how your character is mechanically built</em>. Illusions reward split-second creative and lateral thinking as well as engaging with the world in a way that goes beyond collecting numeric bonuses or seeking feats that synergize well each time you level up.</p>
			
			<p>Using Illusions well is one of the most challenging and fun ways to play. The price of admission is small, too. Just pick up <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/silent-image/" target="_blank">Silent Image</a> as one of your level 1<sup>st</sup> level spells and you're golden. This guide assumes you're more committed to the Art of Illusion, though!</p>
			
			<p>This is a guide for those who want to use Illusions in their purest sense - to confound and manipulate their opponents' beliefs and actions. Illusions such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#TOC-lllusion-Pattern" target="_blank">patterns</a> and buffs like <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/mirror-image/" target="_blank">Mirror Image</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/displacement/" target="_blank">Displacement</a> have straight-forward effects that are less flexible than general purpose <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#TOC-lllusion-Figment" target="_blank">figments</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#TOC-lllusion-Glamer" target="_blank">glamers</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#TOC-lllusion-Phantasm" target="_blank">phantasms</a> like <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/major-image/" target="_blank">Major Image</a>, <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/v/veil/" target="_blank">Veil</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/audiovisual-hallucination/" target="_blank">Audiovisual Hallucination</a>. This guide focuses on the later general-purpose Illusions.</p>
			
			<h2>Step 1: Know Your Opponent's Motivations</h2>
			
			<h3>Types of Motivations</h3>
			
			<p><span tooltip="Not just combatants. Anyone who opposes you socially, politically, etc too">Opponents</span> only oppose you because they have <em>some reason to do so</em>. That's their motivation, and understanding it is the first step toward manipulation.</p>
			
			<p>All motivations fall into one (or more) of three categories:</p>

			<div class="accordion">
				<dl>
					<dt>
						<a href="#motivation-type-desire" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="motivation-type-desire" class="accordion-title accordionTitle js-accordionTrigger">
							Desire
						</a>
					</dt>
					<dd class="accordion-content accordionItem is-collapsed" id="motivation-type-desire" aria-hidden="true">
						<div class="base-accordion-content has-example js-exampleToggle is-expanded" aria-hidden="false">
							<p>Your opponent wants something, and they think the best way to get it is to oppose your party - even if it means incurring whatever risk is involved with that.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="base-accordion-example has-example js-exampleToggle is-collapsed" aria-hidden="true">
							<ul>
								<li>The ruthless idealist who wants to destroy this wicked world so that a <strong>new Utopia may be built</strong> from its ashes.</li>
								<li>The mercenary who fights to earn money for <strong>gambling, drinking, and womanising</strong>.</li>
								<li>The psychopath who gets <strong>pleasure</strong> from the act of killing itself.</li>
								<li>The assassin seeking <strong>vengeance</strong> on you for killing his only brother.</li>
								<li>The Accuser Devil, spying on you because you've caught the interest of its fiendish master, and it <strong>seeks promotion</strong> in Hell's bureaucracy.</li>
								<li>The adult highwayman who robs travellers to <strong>provide for the band of thieves</strong> who saved him as a child from starving on the streets.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</dd>

							<p>Your opponent doesn't want something to happen, and they think the best way to prevent it from happening is to act against your party.</p>
							<p>Fear is simply a form of desire to <em>maintain what one already has</em>. Loss aversion tells us that fear is a more powerful motivator than desire, but a fearful creature can be desperate and unpredictable so manipulating fear is a double-edged sword.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="base-accordion-example has-example js-exampleToggle is-collapsed" aria-hidden="true">

								<li>The conscripted soldier, who'd rather take his chances fighting than <strong>be executed</strong> as a deserter.</li>
								<li>The shrewd Duke, who sees the neighbouring Baron's growing political influence as a threat to <strong>his position</strong>.</li>
								<li>The travelling surveyor, who worries if he tells you of the ancient ruins he discovered then he'd lose his monopoly on the supply of <strong>valuable riches</strong> that surely lie therein.</li>
								<li>The mother bear, who sees you as a threat to her <strong>nearby cubs</strong>.</li>

							<p>Creatures acting out of instinct do not have a willful reason for their behavior. Their actions are being driven by a set of guidelines that have been useful for their continued survival in the past.</p>
							<p>Most creatures have at least some instincts (desire to eat, reproduce, etc), but creatures possessing wills of their own can usually overrule their instincts using judgement of their circumstances in a particular situation. Mindless creatures (oozes, vermin, some undead) have behaviors driven entirely by instinct.</p>

			<h3>Determining Opponent Motivations</h3>
			
			<p>Which method you should use to determine your opponents' motivations depends on your ability and willingness to spend time, accept risk, and expend resources.</p>

						<a href="#motivation-methods-immediate" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="motivation-methods-immediate" class="accordion-title accordionTitle js-accordionTrigger">

							<p>Involves using observation and inference about an opponent, their behavior, and their immediate environment to put together high probability guesses about an opponent's motivations. Ask yourself the following questions about your opponent:</p>
							
							<ul>
								<li>What demographics do they belong to? What is their race? Gender? Age? Manner of speaking? Vocabulary? What do these things imply about their likely background, wealth, level of education, and occupational possibilities?</li>
								<li>How do they look? How are they dressed? What are their weapons, gear, and other belongings? Why do they have these things?</li>
								<li>What are they doing? Why? What are they <em>prevented</em> from doing that they may want to be doing?</li>
								<li>Where are they? Why are they here? Have they altered the immediate environment in some way? What context clues does that provide?</li>
								<li>With whom are they associating? What do you know about these associates? Why would your opponent want to associate with them?</li>
								<li>What does their facial expression and body language tell you about their emotional state? Why might they be feeling that?</li>
								<li>Remember to cross-check your observations with your Knowledge skills! The often-neglected Knowledges like nobility, geography, history, and local can be invaluable for humanoid opponents, who typically have the most complex motivations. This takes no time and has no risk so it's always good!</li>
								<li>Your GM often (unintentionally) does a huge amount of this work for you, letting more information than you strictly would know slip. If you ever hear something like "You see <strong>a soldier</strong> approaching you" then you've just learned a huge amount about that person's likely motivations for free.</li>
								<li>Key spells: <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-desires" target="_blank">Detect Desires</a> and <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-anxieties" target="_blank">Detect Anxieties</a> provide a higher-risk, higher-accuracy way to quickly get exactly what you want.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<p>Observation and inference can always be done in zero time and carries no risk for gathering the information itself, so it's the method you'll use most often, however it's the least accurate of all the methods. Use caution and always have a backup excuse for why you got a guess wrong.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="base-accordion-example has-example js-exampleToggle is-collapsed" aria-hidden="true">
							<p>You're travelling along a remote, desolate road when you see a middle-aged Dwarf male in brown leather clothing on the side of the road. He's sitting on an anvil, whittling a stick. Nearby him are wooden barrels and crates. You see iron tools and weapons sticking out the top of some of them. Nearby is a grinding wheel-style whetstone.</p>
							<p>As you approach and he takes notice of you, he drops the stick, stands up, and leans visibly against his greataxe. He makes no attempt to flag you down or draw your attention, but simply watches as you pass by. You notice its getting late in the evening and he's not set up a camp nor does he seem to have any nearby camping gear.</p>
							<p>Based on what you have observed, what can you conclude about this Dwarf, his situation, and his motivations?</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The nearby equipment is too cumbersome and heavy even for a Dwarf to carry on his own. In other words, the equipment (and probably the Dwarf as well) must've been carried there by something like a horse-drawn cart. No such transport is in sight, though.</li>
								<li>His staying with the equipment and his not-so-subtle display of force when you approached demonstrates a vested interest in protecting the equipment. His level of intimacy toward it (sitting on it) suggests it may belong to him.</li>
								<li>The nearby tools look to be those that a blacksmith (or similar) might use. If the tools belong to the Dwarf, then he's likely a craftsman by profession.</li>
								<li>Craftsmen don't often go to the trouble of carrying their entire shop around with them, so he must've had a good reason for doing so. Perhaps he's moving his business from one area to another?</li>
								<li>If so, how did he come to be stranded in such a desolate place? Did something go awry mid-transit? What is he going to do about it?</li>
								<li>The fact that he was just sitting on an anvil whittling before he noticed you, suggests he was <em>waiting</em> for something, rather than trying to achieve something himself.</li>
								<li>The fact that he has made no preparations for the fast-approaching night, and made no attempt to solicit your help, suggests that he already has help coming and they <em>will be there soon</em>.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Based on observation and inference alone, you've now put together a high-probability picture of this person, his situation, and his motivations. Now you can use your Knowledge skills to color in more details, like where is he likely coming from and going to.</p>

							<p>Involves devoting time to observing an opponent in order to gather a larger amount of information than can be immediately obtained by a quick reading or confirming the accuracy of your conclusions. May be done if the opponent is aware of you or not. Usually doesn't involve direct interaction with the opponent.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The safest way to observe an opponent long-term without being observed yourself is sheer distance. Each 10 feet you are away from the opponent gives your opponent +1 to the perception DC to notice you. This penalty applies to you as well so a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/tools-kits/#TOC-Telescope" target="_blank">telescope</a> (though pricey) may be a wise investment. Remember that <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/silent-image/" target="_blank">image</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/auditory-hallucination/" target="_blank">hallucination</a> spells come with long range (400+ ft/+40 or more to perception DC) standard. Use this!</li>
								<li>Always prepare a contingency plan ahead of time for what to do if you get caught spying. This could be a lie about why you were following the opponent or why you were in a place you shouldn't be, or it could be a hasty escape or hiding plan before the opponent is able to confirm their suspicion that they're being tailed or watched.</li>
								<li>As long as you don't go far out of your way and know where an opponent is, doing a long-term stakeout can be combined with normal camping easily. Just have your nightly watch shifts primarily keep an eye on the opponents' residence, camp spot, place of business, etc. Learn their habits, associates, available resources, and so on so you can take action after you've rested up.</li>
								<li>Be prepared to split up the party if your opponents split up or meet someone new you need to tail. Party members without sneaky skills/spells can usually make due with the disguise skills of other party members or serve as the long-range lookouts and shot callers. Agree ahead of time on a long-distance method of communicating important information and orders, which could be as simple as using <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dancing-lights/" target="_blank">Dancing Lights</a> to manifest visual signals in the night sky or using a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-gear/#TOC-Whistle" target="_blank">dog whistle</a> to cause all dogs within a quarter-mile to start barking.</li>
								<li>Use spell effects as proxy spies. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/alarm/" target="_blank">Alarm</a> is great. Even better is <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/magic-mouth/" target="_blank">Magic Mouth</a>, which is permanent but 10g per cast and allows you to set arbitrary visible or audible conditions upon which the spell effect will expire. For example, set the trigger "If person of interest X (cue <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/silent-image/" target="_blank">Silent Image</a> 3D hologram of what X looks like) enters this house, breathe a whispered sigh after they close the door." Come back later and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-magic/" target="_blank">Detect Magic</a> to see if your spell effect is still there. If it's not, you know person X entered the house. Since you can have Magic Mouth react to the sound of other Magic Mouths, you can make triggers and behaviors arbitrarily complex to do whatever you want! (Bonus assignment: Turing-Complete Magic Mouth Computer)</li>
								<li>Key spells: In addition to well-known staples of spying like <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/scrying" target="_blank">Scrying</a>, <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/prying-eyes" target="_blank">Prying Eyes</a>, and the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/l/locate-object" target="_blank">Locate spells</a>, don't miss these great lesser-known spells: <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/discern-next-of-kin" target="_blank">Discern Next of Kin</a> (for indirectly getting the information you need via social engineering with little risk), <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/pack-empathy" target="_blank">Pack Empathy</a> (for communication), and <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/k/keep-watch" target="_blank">Keep Watch</a> (every Private Investigator's dream).</li>

			<p>As a quality of life note, please be aware of what the other players and GM want from the game. You may be stoked on running a protracted espionage campaign against a target of interest, but the Barbarian may just want to kick his door down and threaten him to give up the information you need so he can get back to bashing skulls. I'd say a deception-based Illusionist can be useful in all campaigns, even those that don't focus on subterfuge, but he or she must be flexible enough to practice under the constraints of what everyone else wants out of the game as well.</p>
