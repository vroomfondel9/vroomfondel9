			<h1>Deception and Manipulation: A Playstyle Guide for Illusionists</h1>
			
			<h3>A <em>Playstyle</em> Guide?</h3>
			
			<p>This is a guide about how to most effectively deceive and manipulate your opponents, with a focus on Illusions. This is not a mechanics guide. It will not tell you the best way to build an Illusionist or give you <span style="color: blue;">color</span>-<span style="color: red;">coded</span> spell, class, and race choices.</p>
			
			<p>The reason for this is because the effectiveness of an Illusionist is more dependent on <em>how you play</em> rather than <em>how your character is mechanically built</em>. Illusions reward split-second creative and lateral thinking as well as engaging with the world in a way that goes beyond collecting numeric bonuses or seeking feats that synergize well each time you level up.</p>
			
			<p>Using Illusions well is one of the most challenging and fun ways to play. The price of admission is small, too. Just pick up <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/silent-image/" target="_blank">Silent Image</a> as one of your level 1<sup>st</sup> level spells and you're golden. This guide assumes you're more committed to the Art of Illusion, though!</p>
			
			<p>This is a guide for those who want to use Illusions in their purest sense - to confound and manipulate their opponents' beliefs and actions. Illusions such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#TOC-lllusion-Pattern" target="_blank">patterns</a> and buffs like <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/mirror-image/" target="_blank">Mirror Image</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/displacement/" target="_blank">Displacement</a> have straight-forward effects that are less flexible than general purpose <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#TOC-lllusion-Figment" target="_blank">figments</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#TOC-lllusion-Glamer" target="_blank">glamers</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#TOC-lllusion-Phantasm" target="_blank">phantasms</a> like <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/major-image/" target="_blank">Major Image</a>, <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/v/veil/" target="_blank">Veil</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/audiovisual-hallucination/" target="_blank">Audiovisual Hallucination</a>. This guide focuses on the later general-purpose Illusions.</p>
			
			<h2>Step 1: Know Your Opponent's Motivations</h2>
			
			<h3>Types of Motivations</h3>
			
			<p><span tooltip="Not just combatants. Anyone who opposes you socially, politically, etc too">Opponents</span> only oppose you because they have <em>some reason to do so</em>. That's their motivation, and understanding it is the first step toward manipulation.</p>
			
			<p>All motivations fall into one (or more) of three categories:</p>

							<p>Your opponent wants something, and they think the best way to get it is to oppose your party - even if it means incurring whatever risk is involved with that.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="base-accordion-example has-example js-exampleToggle is-collapsed" aria-hidden="true">
							<ul>
								<li>The ruthless idealist who wants to destroy this wicked world so that a <strong>new Utopia may be built</strong> from its ashes.</li>

								<li>The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/devil/devil-accuser/" target="_blank">Accuser Devil</a>, spying on you because you've caught the interest of its fiendish master, and it <strong>seeks promotion</strong> in Hell's bureaucracy.</li>

			<h3>Determining Opponent Motivations</h3>
			
			<p>Which method you should use to determine your opponents' motivations depends on your ability and willingness to spend time, accept risk, and expend resources.</p>

							<p>Involves using observation and inference about an opponent, their behavior, and their environment to put together high probability, immediate guesses about an opponent's motivations. Ask yourself the following questions about your opponent:</p>
							
							<ul>
								<li>What demographics do they belong to? What is their race? Gender? Age? Manner of speaking? Vocabulary? What do these things imply about their likely background, wealth, level of education, and occupational possibilities?</li>
								<li>How do they look? How are they dressed? What are their weapons, gear, and other belongings? Why do they have these things?</li>
								<li>What are they doing? Why? What are they <em>prevented</em> from doing that they may want to be doing?</li>
								<li>Where are they? Why are they here? Have they altered the immediate environment in some way? What context clues does that provide?</li>
								<li>With whom are they associating? What do you know about these associates? Why would your opponent want to associate with them?</li>
								<li>What does their facial expression and body language tell you about their emotional state? Why might they be feeling that?</li>
								<li>Remember to cross-check your observations with your Knowledge skills! The often-neglected Knowledges like nobility, geography, history, and local can be invaluable for humanoid opponents, who typically have the most complex motivations. Nature, dungeoneering, and religion are usually all you need for determining the instincts of mindless creatures. This takes no time and has no risk so it's always good!</li>
								<li>Your GM often (unintentionally) does a huge amount of this work for you, letting more information than you strictly would know slip. If you ever hear something like "You see <strong>a soldier</strong> approaching you" then you've just learned a huge amount about that person's likely motivations for free.</li>
								<li>Key spells: <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-desires" target="_blank">Detect Desires</a> and <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-anxieties" target="_blank">Detect Anxieties</a> provide a higher-risk, higher-accuracy way to quickly get exactly what you want.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<p>Observation and inference can always be done in zero time and carries no risk for gathering the information itself, so it's the method you'll use most often, however it's the least accurate of all the methods. Use caution and always have a backup excuse for why you got a guess wrong.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="base-accordion-example has-example js-exampleToggle is-collapsed" aria-hidden="true">
							<p>You're travelling along a remote, desolate road when you see a middle-aged, brawny Dwarf male in brown leather clothing on the side of the road. He's sitting on an anvil, whittling a stick. Nearby him are wooden barrels and crates. You see iron tools and weapons sticking out the top of some of them. Nearby is a grinding wheel-style whetstone. It's all wilderness around you for miles.</p>
							<p>As you approach and he takes notice of you, he drops the stick, stands up, and leans visibly against his greataxe. He makes no attempt to flag you down or draw your attention, but simply watches as you pass by. You notice its getting late in the evening and he's not set up a camp nor does he seem to have any nearby camping gear.</p>
							<p>Based on what you have observed, what can you conclude about this Dwarf, his situation, and his motivations?</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The nearby equipment is too cumbersome and heavy even for a Dwarf to carry on his own. In other words, the equipment (and probably the Dwarf as well) must've been carried there by something like a horse-drawn cart. No such transport is in sight, though.</li>
								<li>His staying with the equipment and his not-so-subtle display of force when you approached demonstrates a vested interest in protecting the equipment. His level of intimacy toward it (sitting on it) suggests it may belong to him.</li>
								<li>The nearby tools look to be those that a blacksmith (or similar) might use. If the tools belong to the Dwarf, then he's likely a craftsman by profession. His strong physical build backs this up.</li>
								<li>Craftsmen don't often go to the trouble of carrying their entire shop around with them, so he must've had a good reason for doing so. Perhaps he's moving his business from one area to another?</li>
								<li>If so, how did he come to be stranded in such a desolate place? Did something go awry mid-transit? What is he going to do about it?</li>
								<li>The fact that he was just sitting on an anvil whittling before he noticed you, suggests he was <em>waiting</em> for something, rather than trying to achieve something himself.</li>
								<li>The fact that he has made no preparations for the fast-approaching night, and made no attempt to solicit your help, suggests that he already has help coming and they <em>will be there soon</em>.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Based on observation and inference alone, you've now put together a high-probability picture of this person, his situation, and his motivations. Now you can use your Knowledge skills to color in more details, like where is he likely coming from and going to.</p>

							<p>Involves devoting a larger amount of time to observing an opponent than a quick reading in order to gather a larger amount of information or confirm the accuracy of your information. May be done if the opponent is aware of you or not, depending on context. Usually doesn't involve direct interaction with the opponent.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>As long as the context allows for it and its not obvious you're surveilling your opponent, you can often get away with it openly, such as eavesdropping in public.</li>
								<li>The safest way to observe an opponent long-term without being observed yourself is sheer distance. Each 10 feet you are away from the opponent gives your opponent +1 to the perception DC to notice you. This penalty applies to you as well so a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/tools-kits/#TOC-Telescope" target="_blank">telescope</a> (though pricey) may be a wise investment. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/clairaudience-clairvoyance/" target="_blank">Clairaudience</a> or some <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/spectacles-of-lip-reading/" target="_blank">magic goggles</a> will help with eavesdropping. Remember that <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/silent-image/" target="_blank">image</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/auditory-hallucination/" target="_blank">hallucination</a> spells come with long range (400+ ft) standard. Use this to your advantage!</li>
								<li>Always prepare a contingency plan ahead of time for what to do if you get caught spying. This could be a lie about why you were following the opponent or why you were in a place you shouldn't be, or it could be a hasty escape or hiding plan before the opponent is able to confirm their suspicion that they're being tailed or watched.</li>
								<li>As long as you don't go far out of your way and know where an opponent is, doing a long-term stakeout can be combined with normal camping easily. Just have your nightly watch shifts (or you alone with <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/k/keep-watch" target="_blank">Keep Watch</a>) primarily keep an eye on the opponents' residence, camp spot, place of business, etc. Learn their habits, associates, available resources, and so on so you can take action after you've rested up.</li>
								<li>If you need to do closer-range surveillance, such as indoors or underground, plop yourself down inside of any figment illusion such as <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/silent-image/" target="_blank">images</a>. Be careful if the opponent is familiar with the location, though! They may become suspicious of the new rock or potted plant that appeared!</li>
								<li>Be prepared to split up the party if your opponents split up or meet someone new you need to tail. Party members without sneaky skills/spells can usually make due with the disguise skills of other party members or serve as the long-range lookouts and shot callers. Agree ahead of time on a long-distance method of communicating important information and orders, which could be as simple as using <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dancing-lights/" target="_blank">Dancing Lights</a> to manifest visual signals in the night sky or using a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-gear/#TOC-Whistle" target="_blank">dog whistle</a> to cause all dogs within a quarter-mile to start barking. <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/pack-empathy" target="_blank">Pack Empathy</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/telepathic-bond/" target="_blank">Telepathic Bond</a> are great if you want fancier options. Have a fast way to reach party members if need be should things go south.</li>
								<li>Use spell effects as proxy spies. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/alarm/" target="_blank">Alarm</a> is great. Even better is <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/magic-mouth/" target="_blank">Magic Mouth</a>, which is permanent but 10g per cast and allows you to set arbitrary visible or audible conditions upon which the spell effect will expire. For example, set the trigger "If this person (cue <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/silent-image/" target="_blank">Silent Image</a> 3D hologram of what they look like) enters this house, breathe a whispered sigh after they close the door." Come back later and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-magic/" target="_blank">Detect Magic</a> to see if your spell effect is still there. If it's not, you know your person of interest entered the house. Since you can have Magic Mouth react to the sound of other Magic Mouths, you can make triggers and behaviors arbitrarily complex to do whatever you want! (Bonus assignment: Turing-Complete Magic Mouth Computer)</li>

								<li>You eavesdrop on your opponent in a tavern. As long as your listening is discrete, it doesn't matter if your opponent sees you undisguised. You're just another bar patron. If they do even notice you, they will probably not remember you.</li>
								<li>You post yourself on a knoll overlooking a bandit camp 400 feet away. No one in the camp can see you because they have to meet a DC 40 perception check even if you're not trying to hide. Your 2,000g, x10 magnification telescope means you have to meet a perception DC of 4 to see them.</li>
								<li>You arrive early at the wooded clearing which you earlier learned will be the meeting place between your opponent and an associate. You create a <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/silent-image/" target="_blank">figment of a tree</a> and sit directly inside of it, waiting to listen in on the meeting. As long as your opponents don't interact with the tree, they have no chance to notice you through vision. Since you disbelieve the illusion, it's transparent to you so you can see everything.</li>

							<p>Involves direct interaction in order to try to determine motivations. This could be overt or covert, direct or indirect, subtle or noticeable. It may involve creating sub-deceptions in order to extract the information under false pretences.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Be as subtle, mundane, and unmemorable as possible! The idea is to leave no impression that can be later traced back to you.</li>
								<li>If you're going to be overt and memorable, make sure to take steps so that your interaction, if investigated later, will be a dead end. Disguise is a minimum here!</li>
								<li>Indirect interaction is usually preferable to direct interaction. Rather than trying to deceive your opponent directly, deceive those close to your opponent who have the information you need. This is harder to trace back to you and often its easier to get the information, because your opponent's priorities and concerns often aren't shared by those close to her. The little-used <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/discern-next-of-kin/" target="_blank">Discern Next of Kin</a> spell is great for this.</li>
								<li>When creating a set of false pretences, one of the most effective ways to do it is to convince the target that some very minor mishap has occurred and if they just cooperate with you in some small way, then they'll avoid a much greater hassle. Use their own self-interest against them. Do not make it such a major event that they might call for backup or otherwise scrutinize the situation just to be on the safe side. Simplicity is King!</li>
								<li>Always have a prepared excuse to de-escalate and get out if things start going south.</li>
								<li>Always be prepared for a total emergency where you're found out and can't leave things as they are. This could be a party waiting in ambush, a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/charm-person/" target="_blank">subtle save-or-de-escalate spell</a>, or the like.</li>
								<li>Key spells: <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/disguise-self/" target="_blank">Disguise Self</a> (or <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/v/veil/" target="_blank">Veil</a> for backup), <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/anonymous-interaction" target="_blank">Anonymous Interaction</a>, any Illusions necessary to give credibility to your false pretences.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>This method is the best way to get the answers you need quickly, but it's also the riskiest. You're creating memories of your interactions in the minds of those you interact with, and a shrewd opponent may use those memories to trace back to you even well after the fact. Cover your tracks and beware!</p>
						</div>
						<div class="base-accordion-example has-example js-exampleToggle is-collapsed" aria-hidden="true">
							<ul>
								<li>You disguise as a tradesman and ask the coach driver waiting outside your opponent's mansion if he wouldn't mind watching your bag for a bit while you run home to grab something you forgot. Their response will usually tell you how long you can expect until your opponent is expected to leave. Your short exchange is so boring and mundane, the coach driver likely won't even remember it later.</li>
								<li>You disguise as your opponent and "happen" to run into the letter-carrier. You tell him that you'd like all your correspondence forwarded to a new address for the time being. Not only do you get information, and build out the web of known associates, but you can forge information and pass it along to your opponent. Of course, discard the temporary address later.</li>
								<li>You intercept an unknown shipment from your opponent to a third party en route, posing as the intended recipient. The delivery man is convinced you've saved him the trouble of going all the way to their destination. This is basically the previous example in reverse.</li>

			<p>As a quality of life note, please be aware of what the other players and GM want from the game. You may be stoked on running a protracted espionage campaign against a target of interest, but the Barbarian may just want to kick his door down and threaten him to give up the information you need so he can get back to bashing skulls. I'd say a deception-based Illusionist can be useful in all campaigns, even those that don't focus on subterfuge, but he or she must be flexible enough to practice under the constraints of what everyone else wants out of the game as well.</p>

							<p>There are a set of motivations that are so common that they might be considered (nearly) universal. You can usually make the fairly safe assumption that your opponent has these motivations.</p>
							<p>Individual motivations can often overpower these universal motivations in cases where they come into conflict.

								<li>Avoidance of physical pain. Desire for physical pleasure.</li>

							<p>You're ambushed suddenly when travelling along a forested road. Since you fail to perceive your opponents due to them being hidden in the thick overgrowth, you gain very little information about their motivations - only that they're archers, they're somewhere to your left, and they wish to conceal themselves from you.</p>
							<p>You deduce they must be intelligent creatures and therefore subject to desire and fear. You infer they may be keeping themselves hidden from you in order to reduce the likelihood you'll physically retaliate against them (a difficult feat if you don't know where they are). You decide to test this by choosing the universal fear of physical pain.</p>
							<p>You create a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/major-image/" target="_blank">figment of flames</a> within the underbrush, fast spreading toward their estimated location. Faced with the choice of certain pain from remaining in place versus <em>possible</em> pain from you discovering their location, they flee out from the flammable brush and into the nearby open clearing. This allows you to observe them, gain valuable information, and plan your next steps.</p>
