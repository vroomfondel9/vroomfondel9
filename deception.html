			<h1>Deception and Manipulation: A Playstyle Guide for Illusionists</h1>
			
			<h3>A <em>Playstyle</em> Guide?</h3>
			
			<p>This is a guide about how to most effectively deceive and manipulate your opponents with Illusions. This is not a mechanics guide. It will not tell you the best way to build an Illusionist or give you <span style="color: blue;">color</span>-<span style="color: red;">coded</span> spell, class, and race choices.</p>
			
			<p>The reason for this is because the effectiveness of an Illusionist is more dependent on <em>how you play</em> rather than <em>how your character is mechanically built</em>. Illusions reward split-second creative and lateral thinking as well as engaging with the world in a way that goes beyond collecting numeric bonuses or seeking feats that synergize well each time you level up.</p>
			
			<p>Using Illusions well is one of the most challenging and fun ways to play. The price of admission is small, too. Just pick up <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/silent-image/" target="_blank">Silent Image</a> as one of your level 1<sup>st</sup> level spells and you're golden. This guide assumes you're more committed to the Art of Illusion, though!</p>
			
			<p>This is a guide for those who want to use Illusions in their purest sense - to confound and manipulate their opponents' beliefs and actions. Illusions such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#TOC-lllusion-Pattern" target="_blank">patterns</a> and buffs like <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/mirror-image/" target="_blank">Mirror Image</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/displacement/" target="_blank">Displacement</a> have straight-forward effects that are less flexible than general purpose <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#TOC-lllusion-Figment" target="_blank">figments</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#TOC-lllusion-Glamer" target="_blank">glamers</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#TOC-lllusion-Phantasm" target="_blank">phantasms</a> like <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/major-image/" target="_blank">Major Image</a>, <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/v/veil/" target="_blank">Veil</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/audiovisual-hallucination/" target="_blank">Audiovisual Hallucination</a>. This guide focuses on the later general-purpose Illusions.</p>
			
			<h2>Step 1: Know Your Opponent's Motivations</h2>
			
			<h3>Types of Motivations</h3>
			
			<p><span tooltip="Not just combatants. Anyone who opposes you socially, politically, etc too">Opponents</span> only oppose you because they have <em>some reason to do so</em>. That's their motivation, and understanding it is the first step toward manipulation.</p>
			
			<p>All motivations fall into one (or more) of three categories:</p>

			<div class="accordion">
				<dl>
					<dt>
						<a href="#motivation-type-desire" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="motivation-type-desire" class="accordion-title accordionTitle js-accordionTrigger">
							Desire

					</dt>
					<dd class="accordion-content accordionItem is-collapsed" id="motivation-type-desire" aria-hidden="true">
						<div class="base-accordion-content has-example js-exampleToggle is-expanded" aria-hidden="false">
							<p>Your opponent wants something, and they think the best way to get it is to oppose your party - even if it means incurring whatever risk is involved with that.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="base-accordion-example has-example js-exampleToggle is-collapsed" aria-hidden="true">
							<ul>
								<li>The ruthless idealist who wants to destroy this wicked world so that a <strong>new Utopia may be built</strong> from its ashes.</li>
								<li>The mercenary who fights to earn money for <strong>gambling, drinking, and womanising</strong>.</li>
								<li>The psychopath who gets <strong>pleasure</strong> from the act of killing itself.</li>
								<li>The assassin seeking <strong>vengeance</strong> on you for killing his only brother.</li>
								<li>The Accuser Devil, spying on you because you've caught the interest of its fiendish master, and it <strong>seeks promotion</strong> in Hell's bureaucracy.</li>
								<li>The adult highwayman who robs travellers to <strong>provide for the band of thieves</strong> who saved him as a child from starving on the streets.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>Fear is simply a form of desire to <em>maintain what one already has</em>. Loss aversion tells us that fear is a more powerful motivator than desire, but a fearful creature can be desperate and unpredictable so manipulating fear is a double-edged sword.</p>

								<li>The travelling surveyor, who worries if he tells you of the ancient ruins he discovered then he'd lose his monopoly on the supply of <strong>valuable riches</strong> that surely lie therein.</li>

			<h3>Determining Opponent Motivations</h3>
			
			<p>Which method you should use to determine your opponents' motivations depends on your ability and willingness to spend time, accept risk, and expend resources.</p>
			
			<div class="accordion">
				<dl>
					<dt>
						<a href="#motivation-methods-immediate" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="motivation-methods-immediate" class="accordion-title accordionTitle js-accordionTrigger">

						<div class="base-accordion-content has-example js-exampleToggle is-expanded" aria-hidden="false">
							<p>Involves using observation and inference about an opponent, their behavior, and their immediate environment to put together high probability guesses about an opponent's motivations. Ask yourself the following questions about your opponent:</p>
							
							<ul>
								<li>What demographics do they belong to? What is their race? Gender? Age? Manner of speaking? Vocabulary? What do these things imply about their likely background, wealth, level of education, and occupational possibilities?</li>
								<li>How do they look? How are they dressed? What are their weapons, gear, and other belongings? Why do they have these things?</li>
								<li>What are they doing? Why? What are they <em>prevented</em> from doing that they may want to be doing?</li>
								<li>Where are they? Why are they here? Have they altered the immediate environment in some way? What context clues does that provide?</li>
								<li>With whom are they associating? What do you know about these associates? Why would your opponent want to associate with them?</li>
								<li>What does their facial expression and body language tell you about their emotional state? Why might they be feeling that?</li>
								<li>Remember to cross-check your observations with your Knowledge skills! The often-neglected Knowledges like nobility, geography, history, and local can be invaluable for humanoid opponents, who typically have the most complex motivations. This takes no time and has no risk so it's always good!</li>
								<li>Your GM often (unintentionally) does a huge amount of this work for you, letting more information than you strictly would know slip. If you ever hear something like "You see <strong>a soldier</strong> approaching you" then you've just learned a huge amount about that person's likely motivations for free.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<p>Observation and inference can always be done in zero time and carries no risk for gathering the information itself, so it's the method you'll use most often, however it's the least accurate of all the methods. Use caution and always have a backup excuse for why you got a guess wrong.</p>
