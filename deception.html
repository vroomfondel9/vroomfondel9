			<h1>Deception and Manipulation: A Playstyle Guide for Illusionists</h1>
			
			<h3>A <em>Playstyle</em> Guide?</h3>
			
			<p>This is a guide about how to most effectively deceive and manipulate your opponents with Illusions. This is not a mechanics guide. It will not tell you the best way to build an Illusionist or give you <span style="color: blue;">color</span>-<span style="color: red;">coded</span> spell, class, and race choices.</p>
			
			<p>The reason for this is because the effectiveness of an Illusionist is more dependent on <em>how you play</em> rather than <em>how your character is mechanically built</em>. Illusions reward split-second creative and lateral thinking as well as engaging with the world in a way that goes beyond collecting numeric bonuses or seeking feats that synergize well each time you level up.</p>
			
			<p>Using Illusions well is one of the most challenging and fun ways to play. The price of admission is small, too. Just pick up <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/silent-image/" target="_blank">Silent Image</a> as one of your level 1<sup>st</sup> level spells and you're golden. This guide assumes you're more committed to the Art of Illusion, though!</p>
			
			<p>This is a guide for those who want to use Illusions in their purest sense - to confound and manipulate their opponents' beliefs and actions. Illusions such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#TOC-lllusion-Pattern" target="_blank">patterns</a> and buffs like <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/mirror-image/" target="_blank">Mirror Image</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/displacement/" target="_blank">Displacement</a> have straight-forward effects that are less flexible than general purpose <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#TOC-lllusion-Figment" target="_blank">figments</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#TOC-lllusion-Glamer" target="_blank">glamers</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#TOC-lllusion-Phantasm" target="_blank">phantasms</a> like <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/major-image/" target="_blank">Major Image</a>, <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/v/veil/" target="_blank">Veil</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/audiovisual-hallucination/" target="_blank">Audiovisual Hallucination</a>. This guide focuses on the later general-purpose Illusions.</p>
			
			<h2>Step 1: Know Your Opponent's Motivations</h2>
			
			<p><span tooltip="Not just combatants. Anyone who opposes you socially, politically, etc too">Opponents</span> only oppose you because they have <em>some reason to do so</em>. That's their motivation, and understanding it is the first step toward manipulation.</p>
			
			<p>All motivations fall into one (or more) of three categories:</p>

			<div class="accordion">
				<dl>
					<dt>
						<a href="#motivation-desire" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="motivation-desire" class="accordion-title accordionTitle js-accordionTrigger">
							Desire
						</a>
					</dt>
					<dd class="accordion-content accordionItem is-collapsed" id="motivation-desire" aria-hidden="true">
						<div class="base-accordion-content has-example js-exampleToggle is-expanded" aria-hidden="false">
							<p>Your opponent wants something, and they think the best way to get it is to oppose your party - even if it means incurring whatever risk is involved with that.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="base-accordion-example has-example js-exampleToggle is-collapsed" aria-hidden="true">
							<ul>
								<li>The ruthless idealist who wants to destroy this wicked world so that a <strong>new Utopia may be built</strong> from its ashes.</li>
								<li>The mercenary who fights to earn money for <strong>gambling, drinking, and womanising</strong>.</li>
								<li>The psychopath who gets <strong>pleasure</strong> from the act of killing itself.</li>
								<li>The assassin seeking <strong>vengeance</strong> on you for killing his only brother.</li>
								<li>The Accuser Devil, spying on you because you've caught the interest of its fiendish master, and it <strong>seeks promotion</strong> in Hell's bureaucracy.</li>
								<li>The adult highwayman who robs travellers to <strong>provide for the band of thieves</strong> who saved him as a child from starving on the streets.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</dd>
					<dt>
						<a href="#motivation-fear" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="motivation-fear" class="accordion-title accordionTitle js-accordionTrigger">
							Fear
						</a>
					</dt>
					<dd class="accordion-content accordionItem is-collapsed" id="motivation-fear" aria-hidden="true">
						<div class="base-accordion-content has-example js-exampleToggle is-expanded" aria-hidden="false">
							<p>Your opponent doesn't want something to happen, and they think the best way to prevent it from happening is to act against your party.</p>
							<p>Fear is simply a form of desire to <em>maintain what one already has</em>. Loss aversion tells us that fear is a more powerful motivator than desire, but a fearful creature can be desperate and unpredictable so manipulating fear is a double-edged sword.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="base-accordion-example has-example js-exampleToggle is-collapsed" aria-hidden="true">
							<ul>
								<li>The conscripted soldier, who'd rather take his chances fighting than <strong>be executed</strong> as a deserter.</li>
								<li>The shrewd Duke, who sees the neighbouring Baron's growing political influence as a threat to <strong>his position</strong>.</li>
								<li>The travelling surveyor, who worries if he tells you of the ancient ruins he discovered then he'd lose his monopoly on the supply of <strong>valuable riches</strong> that surely lie therein.</li>
								<li>The mother bear, who sees you as a threat to her <strong>nearby cubs</strong>.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</dd>
					<dt>
						<a href="#motivation-instinct" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="motivation-instinct" class="accordion-title accordionTitle js-accordionTrigger">
							Instinct
						</a>
